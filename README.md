## What
A simple test runner for TypeScript.

## Why
I am just sick of these crazy tool chains to work on simple projects.

## How
**1. Compile Source Files:** This step involves compiling the application's source code (written in TypeScript) into JavaScript, which can then be run in a browser or on a server. This step ensures that the application is properly transpiled and ready for testing.

**2. Determine Tests:** In this step, the test runner inspects the compiled code to determine which tests are available to run. This could involve searching for functions or classes with specific names, or using annotations or metadata to identify test cases.

**3. Compile Test Files:** Once the tests have been identified, the test runner compiles the test scripts (also written in TypeScript) into JavaScript. This step ensures that the test code is transpiled and ready for execution.

**4. Run Test Files:** In this step, the test runner executes the compiled test code and reports the results. This involves running each test case and reporting whether it passed or failed, along with any relevant diagnostic information.

**5. Display Results:** Finally, the test runner displays the test results to the user.
